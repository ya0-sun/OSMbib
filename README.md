[Network clusters of keywords](https://app.vosviewer.com/?json=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1EbZDFNeOB0pFYYCwtFcOSIrvx6kGutQO)
* A minimum of 5 occurrences was set as the threshold. Out of 6,264 keywords (both author keywords and key-words plus), 416 met this criterion, and after excluding the two most frequent keywords- “openstreetmap”
with 816 occurrences and “volunteered geographic information” with 225 occurrences - to avoid overshadowing other keywords, a total of 414 keywords were analyzed.
